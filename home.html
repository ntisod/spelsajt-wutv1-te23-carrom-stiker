        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
          Our game is a digital recreation of <strong>Carrom</strong>, the iconic tabletop game rooted in South Asian tradition. It belongs to the category of <strong>casual, turn-based, skill-driven board games</strong>, where precision and strategy take center stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, the game supports a <strong>Singles Mode (1 vs 1)</strong> where two players can enjoy a friendly match. It's easy to pick up, fun to play, and brings the feel of a real carrom board to your screen.
