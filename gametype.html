       Game Type: Classic Board Game – Carrom (1v1 Free Play Mode)
Our game is a digital recreation of Carrom, the iconic tabletop game rooted in South Asian tradition. It belongs to the category of casual, turn-based, skill-driven board games, where precision and strategy take center stage.

In this version, the game supports a Singles Mode (1 vs 1) – perfect for friendly matches between two players. Each player uses a striker to flick discs (carrom men) toward the corner pockets, aiming to pot their designated pieces and score points. The gameplay is intuitive yet challenging, offering a great mix of fun and competition.

While we currently offer only Free Play mode for 1v1 matches, this allows players to enjoy the core mechanics of carrom without restrictions. It's an excellent starting point for anyone wanting to experience the classic feel of carrom in a modern digital format.

More features and modes are planned for future updates, so stay tuned!
