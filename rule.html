        <h2> Objective</h2>
        <p>The goal is to pot all your assigned coins (either black or white) before your opponent. The player who pots the Queen and covers it correctly gets bonus points.</p>
    
        <h3> Basic Rules</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The game is played between 2 players.</li>
          <li>Each player is assigned either Black or White coins (8 each).</li>
          <li>Players take turns to strike using the striker.</li>
          <li>The Queen (red coin) must be potted and then \"covered\" by potting one of your own coins in the same or next turn.</li>
          <li>If the Queen is not covered, it is returned to the center of the board.</li>
          <li>Only the striker is controlled by the player – aim and shoot to pocket coins.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Fouls</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Pocketing the striker (scratch).</li>
          <li>Potting the opponent’s coin intentionally.</li>
          <li>Failing to cover the Queen after potting it.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h5>Winning the Game</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>The first player to pot all of their coins wins the round.</li>
          <li>If the Queen is potted and successfully covered, that player earns a bonus.</li>
          <li>In this version, scores may not be tracked yet – the focus is on basic turn-based play.</li>
        </ul>
