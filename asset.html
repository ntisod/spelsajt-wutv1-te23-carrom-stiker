          The game consists of a square board, 9 white coins, 9 black coins, 1 red queen, and a striker. 
          A smooth powder is often used to reduce friction on the board for better gameplay.But in the game i have used rigidbody for it to slide
          and also added a circle collider for the coins to detect collision with the striker and the board.
